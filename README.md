# Food-App-Backend-API

Hi everyone,
This is a fully backend application API that I have made.

Working of this Food App API:
So, firstly you have to Sign Up to my application.

And after signing up you will have some plans that you can buy for your everyday meals.

Also I have used NodeMailer and Stripe API for sending mails and payments.

# Tech Stack:

1. NODE JS (JS Framework)
2. EXPRESS
3. MONGODB (No SQL Database)
4. JWT (JSON WEB TOKEN for authentication of the users)
5. NODEMAILER  (Sending mails)
6. STRIPE (Sending payments)
7. MULTER (Uploading profile pics)


So this is bascially by fully backend project.
You can make frontend of this very easily.

Try to make frontend for this one, it will help me a lot....
